CONCLUSION
========================================

Your existing web application has an excellent foundation for mobile conversion. The backend requires minimal changes, and the business logic is well-structured for reuse. The main effort will be in converting the Material-UI components to React Native equivalents and optimizing the user experience for mobile devices.

The modular architecture of your current app makes this conversion very feasible, and you'll be able to maintain feature parity between web and mobile versions while providing a native mobile experience.
