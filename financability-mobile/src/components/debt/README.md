- **`MobileDebtPayoffTimelineGrid.tsx`** - Debt payoff timeline grid with strategy selection

### Management Components

- **`MobileDebtManagementModal.tsx`** - Modal for adding, editing, and deleting debts

## Features

### âœ… Complete Feature Parity with Website

1. **Real-Time Budget Editing**
   - Editable cells for income and expense categories
   - Real-time propagation of changes to future months
   - Cell locking for user-edited projected months
   - Automatic net savings calculation

2. **Debt Payoff Timeline**
   - Snowball and Avalanche strategy support
   - Individual debt tracking with payoff progression
   - Principal and interest payment breakdown
   - Remaining debt visualization

3. **Debt Management**
   - Add new debts with full form validation
   - Edit existing debts
   - Delete debts with confirmation
   - Support for all debt types (credit cards, loans, etc.)

4. **Real-Time Updates**
   - Immediate debt recalculation when budget changes
   - Propagation of current month changes to future months
   - Loading states and progress indicators
   - Error handling and user feedback

5. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Touch-friendly interface with appropriate touch targets
   - Horizontal scrolling for wide grids
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes
   - Mobile-optimized modals and forms

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import MobileDebtPlanning from './components/debt/MobileDebtPlanning';

// In your screen component
<MobileDebtPlanning onNavigate={(screen) => navigation.navigate(screen)} />
```

### With Responsive Wrapper

```tsx
import ResponsiveDebtPlanning from './components/debt/ResponsiveDebtPlanning';

// Automatically handles screen size detection
<ResponsiveDebtPlanning onNavigate={(screen) => navigation.navigate(screen)} />
```

## State Management

The component manages extensive state to replicate the website functionality:

### Core State
- `outstandingDebts` - Array of user debts
- `backendBudgets` - Budget data from backend
- `localGridData` - Transformed grid data for display
- `payoffPlan` - Calculated debt payoff plan

### Real-Time Update State
- `gridUpdating` - Grid update in progress
- `isPropagatingChanges` - Propagation in progress
- `lockedCells` - User-edited cells that are locked
- `userEditedCells` - Track of user edits

### UI State
- `selectedTabIndex` - Currently selected tab (0: Budget, 1: Timeline)
- `strategy` - Debt payoff strategy ('snowball' | 'avalanche')
- `debtDialogOpen` - Debt management modal visibility

## Key Functions

### Data Transformation
- `transformBackendBudgetsToGrid()` - Converts backend budget data to grid format
- `recalculateNetSavings()` - Calculates net savings for all months
- `generateMonths()` - Generates historical, current, and future months

### Real-Time Updates
- `onCellValueChanged()` - Handles cell editing with real-time updates
- `handleRealTimeGridUpdate()` - Updates grid data and triggers recalculation
- `propagateCurrentMonthChanges()` - Propagates changes to future months

### Debt Calculations
- `calculateDebtPayoffPlanFrontend()` - Calculates debt payoff plan
- `triggerImmediateDebtRecalculation()` - Triggers debt recalculation

### Debt Management
- `handleDebtSave()` - Saves new or updated debt
- `handleDebtDelete()` - Deletes debt with confirmation

## Mobile-Specific Optimizations

### Touch Interface
- Large touch targets (minimum 44px)
- Swipe gestures for navigation
- Touch feedback with visual states

### Layout
- Single-column layout for mobile screens
- Horizontal scrolling for wide data grids
- Collapsible sections for better space usage

### Performance
- Lazy loading of grid data
- Optimized re-renders with useCallback
- Efficient state updates

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite included:

```bash
# Run tests
npm test MobileDebtPlanning.test.tsx

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage MobileDebtPlanning.test.tsx
```

### Test Coverage
- Component rendering and state management
- User interactions (tabs, modals, forms)
- Data transformation and calculations
- Error handling and edge cases
- Mobile-specific interactions

## Dependencies

### Required Services
- `debtPlanningService` - Backend API integration
- `useTheme` - Theme context for styling

### Required Utils
- `formatCurrency` - Currency formatting
- `formatPercentage` - Percentage formatting

## Styling

The component uses a theme-based styling system:

```tsx
const styles = createStyles(theme) => StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: theme.colors.background,
  },
  // ... more styles
});
```

### Theme Properties Used
- `colors` - Primary, secondary, success, error, warning colors
- `spacing` - Consistent spacing scale
- `borderRadius` - Border radius values
- `typography` - Font sizes and weights

## Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling for:
- Network errors during API calls
- Invalid user input
- Calculation errors
- State synchronization issues

## Performance Considerations

- Debounced API calls to prevent excessive requests
- Memoized calculations with useCallback
- Efficient re-rendering with proper dependency arrays
- Lazy loading of heavy components

## Future Enhancements

- Offline support with local storage
- Advanced chart visualizations
- Export functionality
- Push notifications for debt milestones
- Integration with calendar for payment reminders

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Grid not updating after cell edit**
   - Check if `onCellValueChanged` is properly connected
   - Verify `recalculateNetSavings` is being called

2. **Debt calculations not triggering**
   - Ensure `triggerImmediateDebtRecalculation` is called
   - Check if `outstandingDebts` and `localGridData` are populated

3. **Modal not opening**
   - Verify `debtDialogOpen` state is being set
   - Check if modal is properly rendered in component tree

4. **Styling issues**
   - Ensure theme context is properly provided
   - Check if all required theme properties are defined

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:
```tsx
console.log('ðŸ”„ Debug mode enabled');
```

This will show detailed logs for:
- Cell value changes
- Debt calculations
- State updates
- API calls
